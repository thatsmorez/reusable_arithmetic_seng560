# Reusable Library for WVU's SENG 560 Reusable Software Course

###### Programming Language: Python

##Functions:
- add                        Takes two numberal values as the inputs and sums them together
- subtract                 Takes two numberal values as the inputs and subtracts the second input from the first
- multiply                 Takes two numberal values as the inputs and determines their product
- divide                    Takes two numberal values as the inputs and divides the first input by the second
- square_root          Takes a single numberal value as the input and determines it's square root
- exponent              Takes two numberal values as the inputs and raises the first input to the power of the second
- convert2Octal       Takes a single numberal value (integer, hex, or binary) and converts it to Octal
- convert2Hex         Takes a single numberal value (integer, octal, or binary) and converts it to Hex
- convert2Integer    Takes a single numberal value (octal, binary, hex) and converts it to a integer
- convert2Binary     Takes a single numberal value (integer, octal, hex) and converts it to a binary
